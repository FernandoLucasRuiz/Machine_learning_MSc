# Machine learning MSc Bioinformatics
This repository is designated for the Machine Learning course within the Master's program in Bioinformatics at the University of Murcia. The course aims to learn machine and deep learning techniques such as regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), neural networks, along with clustering techniques, variable grouping, and variable selection.

Within the "PCA_regression_knn_naive-bayes" folder, there is a practice session that uses data from the Boston Housing, Letter Recognition, and Diabetes datasets provided by the US government. This section outlines a preprocessing and data analysis pathway to develop a predictive algorithm.

Additionally, the "SVM_random-forest_Clustering_Diabetes" folder contains an analysis of Diabetes datasets from the US government, employing Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and K-means clustering. This analysis aims to develop models that can effectively predict diabetes outcomes and identify distinct subpopulations within the dataset. Through this multifaceted approach, we explore different aspects of the data, leveraging the strengths of each method to provide comprehensive insights and robust predictive capabilities.
